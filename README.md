# ðŸš€ Explore New Python Libraries

Tired of using the same Python libraries over and over again?  
This project explores powerful **alternatives** to popular tools, some of which can get the job done even **better and faster**.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Project?

While libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib` and others are great, there are newer and lesser-known tools that:
- Simplify your code
- Improve performance
- Enhance visualization
- Provide smarter summaries

## The Python Alternative Tools You Might Also need

| Task | Popular Library | Alternative | Benefit |
|------|------------------|-------------|---------|
| Data overview | `df.info()` + `df.describe()` | `skimpy` | Rich, clean summaries |
| Plotting | `matplotlib` | `plotnine` | Elegant, grammar-of-graphics style |
| Handling big data | `pandas` | `polars` | Blazing fast performance |
| Visualizing missing values | Manual checks | `missingno` | Visual summary in one line |
